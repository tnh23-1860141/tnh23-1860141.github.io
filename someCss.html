            I have 4 dogs. Two of them are Golden Retrievers.  They are both girls and their names are Addy and Ren. The last inside dog is a pug, and his name is Basil. My last dog is a blue healer and his name is Ripper.

            I have one cat and his name is Toast. Yes, his name is toast and he is the chillest cat you will ever meet.  He is very awesome and isn't one of those lame cats.  He is black and white and is a boy as well.
