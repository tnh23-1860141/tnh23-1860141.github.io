 In this lab activity we will practice formatting text in Markdown.

 The following exercise uses text from an article by Jessica Hullman and Matthew Kay on _Uncertainty Visualization_ published [on Medium](medium.com/multiple-views-visualization-research-explained/uncertainty-visualization-explained-67e7a73f031b).

 Before we start, pressing "shift + ctrl + m" will enable the Markdown Preview pane.

**Exercise 1.**

One place where uncertainty comes into play is when we have some target quantity in the world that we want to know (_**a parameter**_ in stats speak). However, often the data we have are limited and cannot _**exactly_** answer the questions we have.

**Exercise 2.**

### Uncertainty + Visualization, Explained
_Jessica Hullman_ and _Matthew Kay_ (the MU Collective)

**Exercise 3.**


**Exercise 4.**

There are different types of uncertainty mentioned in the article: reducible, irreducible

**Exercise 5.**

Even more generally, we can talk about uncertainty in how well our mathematical description of reality matches the real world. Statistical models use imperfect assumptions and approximations about how the world works, and we have uncertainty about how good those approximations are for a problem at hand. Such uncertainty may be qualitative, not quantitative.
